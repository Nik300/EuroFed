## Section 1: Secular Nature of the Federation
The European Federation shall be fully secular with no official or endorsed state religion.

## Section 2: Limits of Religion in Politics
The involvement of religion in the political system and vice versa shall be subject to state monitoring and, as far as is necessary, regulated in order to uphold the principles of secular and uncorrupted governance.

## Section 3: Freedom of Religion
Any individual or religious organisation, without regard to faith or denomination, has the right to unrestrained freedom of belief, insofar as it does not threaten any other individual's personal rights.

## Section 4: Freedom to the Dissemination of Religious Belief
Religious groups have the right to proselytise or otherwise spread their beliefs in a non-intrusive manner, provided that neither the separation of church and state nor the public welfare is threatened.

## Explanation
This article establishes the secular nature of the European Federation, ensuring that no single religion is officially endorsed or favored by the state. It also sets limits on the involvement of religion in politics to maintain secular governance. At the same time, it guarantees freedom of religion and the right to disseminate religious beliefs, as long as these practices do not infringe upon the rights of others or threaten public welfare. This balanced approach aims to protect both religious freedom and the secular nature of the federation.
